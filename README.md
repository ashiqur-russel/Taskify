### Why It Matters

This data model is designed to provide **scalability** and **efficiency** for team-based project management, ensuring seamless collaboration across tasks, teams, and projects. 

- **Accountability**: Each task is clearly assigned to a user, ensuring responsibility is well-defined.
- **Collaboration**: Comments and attachments allow for smooth communication and file sharing within tasks.
- **Project Overview**: Managers can easily track which teams are working on specific projects and monitor progress.
